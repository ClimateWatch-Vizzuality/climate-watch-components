    "Assessment of the impacts of changes in climate on long-lived infrastructure, land-use planning, (Current selection)": "Long-term planning is fundamental for creating and managing robust energy systems, and careful and far sighted policy making is essential to combat climate change in an economically efficient, socially acceptable, and effective manner. Because of the long-lived nature of some energy supply and demand equipment, investments and policy decisions made today will affect the level of greenhouse gases in 2050."

    "Assessment of the impacts of changes in climate on long-lived infrastructure, land-use planning, (Current selection)": "Investing soon in a lower-carbon infrastructure will ease the long-term transition. In contrast, investing in high-carbon infrastructure today would lock in a higher emissions pathway and thus increase the costs of achieving our targets later on.Similarly, in the land sector, taking swift action to increase carbon sequestration now will deliver much larger dividends by mid-century than if we delay."
